# this code is for diagnostic plots of the age parsing and length smoothing in 
# Atlantis output data
# basically, I split each 2 year age group in Atlantis into 1 year age groups based
# on the natural mortality (see code) and then smoothed the lengths to the appropriate
# respective ages using the von Bertalanffy growth curves for each year and month



## this is just to plot actual length/biomass and smoothed length/biomass across time
## to see how they differ. You can also do this facetted by age

## this looks at the growth across months for each age class

## when fish move from one age group to the next
## this is a good test to see if you've accurately
## distributed numbers and lengths properly between years
